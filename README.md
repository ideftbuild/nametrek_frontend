# Nametrek Frontend 🚀

## Project Description

Growing up, I loved playing this word game—it was fun and challenging. Recently, I felt nostalgic and wanted to bring it back. So, I decided to recreate it on the web, mixing old memories with new possibilities. 

Nametrek is a fun and fast-paced game where players race against the clock. The challenge? Name items in a chosen category—countries, animals, cars, or even everyday objects—before time runs out. 

But don't blink! If you hesitate too long or give a wrong answer, you're out! The game keeps going until one quick thinker is crowned the winner. 

It's not just a game—it's a challenge. It pushes you to think quickly, type faster, and stay sharp under pressure. Perfect for friends, families, or anyone who loves a lighthearted yet thrilling way to connect online.
